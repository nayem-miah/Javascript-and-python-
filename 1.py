# print('Hello world')
# print('My name is Nayem Islam')
# print('Im recently learning Javascript newly')
# names = 'Nayem Islma'
# age = 2
# print(names, ' is only ', age, ' years old guy')


#                         1 number lession ------------Naming convention


# page_number = 'thi is called Snakecase. Snakecase: Words are delimited by an underscore. In Python Snakecase is popular'
# pageNumber = 'thi is called Camelcase. Words are delimited by capital letters, except the initial word. In javascript Camelcase is popular'
# PageNumber = 'thi is called Pascalcase'


#                        2 number lession ------------data typ
# there are two type of data type 1. primitive  2. object
#  1. primitive = number, String, Boolean, null, undefined
#  2. object = Array, Object, Functio


#                         3 number lession ------------data type conversion
# age = '23'
# age2 = 10
# inti = int(age)
# print(type(inti))  # string to number

# string = str(age2)
# print(type(string))  # number to string


#                         4 Arithmetic oparator-------------


#  + - * /
#   % = modulus operator
# a = 10
# b = 3
# print(a % b)
#   ++ = increamental oparator.  there are two increamental oparator 1 is pre increamental another is post increamental
#   -- = decreamental oparator.  there are two decreamental oparator 1 is pre decreamental another is post decreamenta


#                              5 assignment oparator


#  = +=  -=  *=  /=   %
# a = 10
# b = 2
# a += b
# print(a)
# a = 10
# b = 2
# a -= b
# print(a)
# a = 10
# b = 2
# a *= b
# print(a)
# a = 10
# b = 2
# a /= b
# print(a)
# a = 10
# b = 2
# a %= b
# print(a)


# 6 comparison oparator -----------
# ==   !=   >    <  >=   <=   ===  !==
# a = 20
# b = 2
# print(a == b)  # false
# print(a != b)  # true
# print(a > b)  # true
# print(a < b)  # false
# print(a >= b)  # true
# print(a <= b)  # false
# print(a < b)  # false
# a = '50'
# b = 50
# print(a == b)  # it will say true though it is not cause  == can not identify data type

# print(a != b)  # it will return True


# # Program to demonstrate conditional operator
# a, b = 10, 20
 
# # Copy value of a in min if a < b else copy b
# min = a if a < b else b
 
# print(min)
